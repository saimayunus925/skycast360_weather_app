Command-Line Weather App

App Name: SkyCast360

Technologies: Python (perhaps Flask if we want to go GUI)

Database: SQLite or MongoDB

API: https://openweathermap.org/api

In this app, we will query the API using Python's _requests_ library. 
We'll get the API response data and create our SQLite database based on that.
